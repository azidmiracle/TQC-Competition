# Introduction
Every year our company holds a Quality competition amoung departments such as production, design and development, accounting etc.
I am in the design and development team and my manager included me in the team of 9 members to formulate an idea that would be beneficial to our department.
We were alloted 6 months for the project including the implementation.

I was assigned in the programming since I am the only one in the team who has the background in programming.
Some of them helped me in the documentation and interface design,one of them was our team leader who monitored the progress of the project, and one did the project presentation during the competition.

My team and our bosses were very proud of us because it was our first time to win the competition.

# Background

We already have an exising database in the company, however the interface is a bit, very to difficult to use, and only one computer has this software.
So, we decided to create our own MS Excel software that retrieve the data from the database with more features.

Unfortunately, we are not allowed to download any data from our server.
All files done inside the company premise are strictly confidential.

I have some photos taken was during our competition.
